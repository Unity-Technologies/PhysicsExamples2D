# 2D Physics Examples
This project contains multiple scenes that are designed to provide both examples of features as well as having the additional benefit that they can be used by Unity QA or developers who wish to test/verify that specific features are working.

A majority of the scenes rely on Unity Gizmos for presentation of Colliders, Joints, Contacts (etc) rather than renderers so please ensure that the "Gizmos" buttons are selected in both the "Scene" and "Game" views otherwise you may find you cannot see the content.

## Game View

All the examples were designed with the Game window set to 16:9 Aspect. It is recommended that you change the Game window to this so that the Camera correctly displays the examples.
