# these settings are based on experiments to see how vs will modify a file after it has been
# manually edited. the settings are meant to match what vs does to minimize unnecessary diffs.

# related notes from research:
#
#   1. rider tends to preserve existing file settings, but we must go with the more strict vs.
#
#   2. file-new templates in vs, rider, and `dotnet new` contain bom's (byte order markers) and
#      crlf. crlf we must preserve because vs, but bom's must be burned with fire. all editors are
#      fine with this.
