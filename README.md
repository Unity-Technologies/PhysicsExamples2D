## Branch Names

Each branch represents a specific version of Unity. As features are added in a public release, those features should be represented in that branch and future Unity version branches i.e. branch names of "2019", "2020", "2021" (etc) exist.

- `master` represents the current latest release of Unity, updated only when new final releases have been public for a while.
- `unsupported/xxx` represents versions that are currently in alpha/beta release state.
